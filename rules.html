        <ul>
          <li>
            It is prohibited from leaving an ongoing game unless it is permitted
            by the format of the game or expressly authorized by an
            administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a participant breaks the previous rule by leaving the game before
            its end, the person will be considered to have finished in 4th place
            in the set.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressing pause (main menu button) is only allowed if all
            participants agree to do so.
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if the above condition is met, it is permitted to pause only in
            one of the following cases:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the participants must absolutely speak to an administrator.
            </li>
            <li>
              A problem occurs with the equipment (e.g., crashing, controller
              disconnection).
            </li>
            <li>
              An emergency beyond the control of the participants occurs (e.g.,
              fire alarm).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            If the two previous articles are not respected, the participant who
            pressed pause will be considered to have finished in 4th place in
            the set.
          </li>
          <li>
            If one of the participants considers they have been the victim of a
            violation of the rules during a game, the participants must not stop
            playing before the game is over. Once the game is over, a
            participant can request an investigation from the administrators
            according to section 8.
          </li>
          <li>
            In any case of interruption, administrators can make the decision to
            restart a game if they wish to do so.
          </li>
